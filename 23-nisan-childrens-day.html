        <p>I've never posted in English on my blog before. Since a few months my stats report that more than 1/3rd of my visitors aren't germans, so I guess it's time to write some stuff in English here as well. International and intercultural thinking suits well today. Today, it's April 23rd - or <strong>23 Nisan</strong>, as Turkish people would say. So what's so special about 23 Nisan? Give me a few lines to lay this out from my personal perspective.</p>
<p>I have roots in Turkey. My parents, my uncles, aunts, nephews and quite a few friends are Turks. Though not born and not living in turkey, I am feeling as a Turk as well. I kind of love my turkish roots. I like turkish traditions like enjoying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_tea">Cay</a> or going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_bath">Hamam</a>. I'm a Muslim as well. My strong belief is that religion, tolerance and respect are tightly coupled together. But one of the most important things of my turkish background surely is my relation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemalist_ideology">Kemalism</a>. To those (probably the most) not being familiar with it: It's not a political kind of thing, more ideological or mental. Don't get me wrong on this. I'm the moderate kind of guy from the next door and I love being such. But what the heck am I starting to paint background with Kemalism here?</p>
<h3 id="thank-you-mr-mustafa-kemal-ataturk">Thank you, Mr. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</h3>
<p>There's a turkish idiom saying "Ne mutlu türküm diyene" ("Glad who claims being Turk"). It's a quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a> - basically the guy who formed the foundation of modern Turkey as you and I know it nowadays. He didn't meant this to be in a patriotic or fundamental way. His perspective was some sort of enlightenment through modernization at that time. His outermost and strong commitment was to <strong>establish the spirit of progress, education and humanity</strong>. And guess what, he succeeded in doing so - at least for me.</p>
<p>He was the one proclaiming this day, April 23rd, as the national and international day of children. "It's the children being our future" he said. In order to keep people being aware about this fact, he just decided to announce Children's Day as official holiday. Boom. It's that easy sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="celebrate-youth-teens-children-kids-babys">Celebrate Youth, Teens, Children, Kids, Babys</h3>
<p>Atatürk's a genius. This "children being our future" statement reminds me of that incredibly admirable <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj8IA6xOpSk">TED Talk of Clifford Stoll</a> a few years ago - his talk is a must see, not only because of his advice to consult kindergarten teachers when you want to know how the future would be. Well, back to my beloved "23 Nisan". From the day of Atatürk's announcement, this day has always been a day full of celebration and honor towards the younger people around us. The teens, kids and babys, you know. Yes, it's worth. No, not only worth, it's important, it's <strong>fundamental to honor and respect our next generation</strong> as we respect and honor our parents and elder fellows as well.</p>
<h3 id="you-are-important">You are important!</h3>
<p>And hey - what's so bad about respecting our future? Nothing. That's why I now ask you - <strong>yes you</strong> - to take action. It's so easy and yet powerful to celebrate 23 Nisan. Following is a rough guide with a top 10 list you can do today to celebrate Children's day with me, the world and all children:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smile!</strong>
    An honest, respectful, warm smile transports a ton of goodness: appreciation, value, respect!</li>
<li><strong>Play a little game!</strong>
    Something like "Noughts and Crosses" or "Spy with my little Eye"...</li>
<li><strong>Treat kids as humans!</strong>
    They might not know all this cool things you know. But they have power and brain enough to understand it!</li>
<li><strong>Give them small presents!</strong>
    Like a small chocolate, fancy crayons, a colorful book...</li>
<li><strong>Give answers to questions!</strong>
    Kids love asking questions, especially why-who-what's. Learn to love answering them (be creative with your answers :-))</li>
<li><strong>Let kids play together!</strong>
    Give them the chance &amp; time to meet each other. Kids have a rigorous and emotional social life.</li>
<li><strong>Support children-friendliness!</strong>
    Organizations, Kindergartens, Schools - whatever it is, it's good to support people supporting kids!</li>
<li><strong>Take care of them!</strong>
    Kids might be sad at times. Even a child's life can be tough. Take care of them and help them to smile again!</li>
<li><strong>Be a kid!</strong>
    Kids love kids. As "adult", it's good, refreshing and fun to adapt perspectives of children. Try it! Have fun!</li>
<li><strong>Be yourself!</strong>
    The true power of a child is honesty. Be honest to others, be honest to kids, be honest to yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p>Come, join and celebrate <strong>23 Nisan - the Children's Day</strong> with me!</p>      </div>
