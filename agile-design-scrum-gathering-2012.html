      <div id="content" class="article">
        <p>It’s only a day now since the <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/events/464-barcelona--global-event">Global Scrum Gathering 2012</a> conference in Barcelona. Yet, I’m still very much impressed. Throughout the whole conference there was activity and productivity.</p>
<p>Plus, this year I had the honor to hold a session about Agile Software Design at the first day of the conference. To be honest, I really was excited about it since this talk was my first I held completely in English. To even add more of a burden to myself, I decided to have two interactive exercises with the audience as well.
I’m really glad and happy that everything went well. The interactive parts were exercised lively and with a good sense of fun. I also got the impression that I achieved to transport my statements and the concepts I presented for the very large part of it.</p>
<p>I’ll hold the same talk twice more in near future and hope I can improve a little more on a few minor things until then. Once I’m through with all presentations I’ll put the slides online.</p>
<p>When it comes to all the other talks and the open space sessions, it’s really a very hard task to highlight some out. Nearly all talks I attended were on a very professional and profound level. The speakers were engaged and so was the audience. I especially liked the coaching clinic and the open space.</p>
<p>I personally think that an open space is a must for a good conference schedule. It not only leaves room for spontaneous or audience-driven content but more often is a handy format to continue and extend conversations about topics being presented earlier on the conference.</p>
<p>For that matter, I pretty much liked the idea from the improuv guys who were organizing this year’s <a href="http://www.agileworld.de/">Agile World 2012</a> in Munich. For all slots, which by the way were themed nicely, they left over an hour of time space at the end of the day for an interactive fishbowl discussion about the topics presented. This idea turned out to be very productive and in fact was often the most valuable hour of the day.</p>
<p>Having this in mind, I found the open spaces at this year’s Scrum Gathering very valuable. There was literally a rainbow of topics to explore and discuss. Scrum Research, Hiring Criteria For Scrum Masters, Agile Fundamentalists, Scrum In Other Industries, Story Organization, Selling Scrum – and that’s just a tiny taste of it.</p>
<p>Although I couldn’t attend all sessions I wanted to – which is a regular constraint I’m hitting at such conferences – I’m all in all quite satisfied with the insights I’m taking with me after these intense days of collaborative thought, self-organized movement and global innovation. </p>
<p>Conclusion: Scrum Gathering 2012 in Barcelona was great!</p>      </div>
