          <p>It's been a while now that <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/17">Fedora 17</a>, the <em>Beefy Miracle</em> has been released to public. This Fedora version comes with a myriad of updates and some very nice and innovative features. However, this post is not about all the gimmicks of F17 rather than a short log about an issue I had after I upgraded my Tablet from Fedora 16 to 17.</p>
<p>I use my Tablet (which is an <em>ExoPC</em>) more like a <em>netbook</em>. I take a wireless keyboard with me and most often use it for research, writing and mails. I'm using Fedora 16 on this device for almost a year now and have had a great experience so far. Plus, I was happy to experience that Gnome 3 fits very well for my scenario.</p>
<h4 id="pre-upgrade">Pre-Upgrade</h4>
<p>Upgrading Fedora is very easy. If you look at the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upgrade">upgrade guide</a>, it's essentially as easy as <code>sudo yum install preupgrade</code> and subsequently executing <code>preupgrade</code>. Really, there's no big deal about it. However, if you happen to plan an upgrade as well, be sure to <em>backup</em> your system and <em>read the docs</em>.</p>
<p>My upgrade procedure went very smooth. The initial boot to F17 was fast and appeared to be without any issues. F17 welcomed me with the usual login screen, I logged in and everything seemed to just work fine. Except one thing: it was slow. And by <em>slow</em>, I mean <em>really slow</em>. Even typing in terminal lagged a few seconds behind the actual keystroke. It seemed to me as if UI performance went back to early 90's.</p>
<h4 id="gnome3-software-rendering">Gnome3 Software Rendering</h4>
<p>After a few minutes of investigation using the usual</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>lspci | grep VGA
glxinfo | grep renderer
</pre></div>


<p>I found out that the new <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Gnome_shell_software_rendering">Gnome-Shell software rendering</a> has caught me. The <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2012-03-29_Gnome_Shell_Software_Rendering">Fedora Test Page</a> for this feature unveiled very useful information for my further analysis. It seemed as if the Intel drivers which happily worked with F16 no longer worked with F17. Obviously, such a theory sounded strange to me, so I further went down to analyze <code>Xorg.0.log</code>.</p>
<p>The analysis uncovered the real issue: The log clearly stated that the intel driver couldn't be loaded:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>(EE) Failed to load module &quot;intel&quot; (module requirement mismatch, 0)
</pre></div>


<p>While digging deeper into the logs and simultanuously researching the web for similar cases, I found that the X-Servers version (1.12) was not the version for which the failing intel driver was compiled (1.6). It obviously was the case that the driver was not suitable for the new X version. I checked the currently installed driver package with </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo yum list installed xorg-x11-drv-intel
</pre></div>


<p>and to my own surprise I saw that the package was still from F16's repositories! The interesting thing was, that an update check with </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo yum check-update
</pre></div>


<p>didn't reveil that I'm on an old (non-working) driver. From my naive perspective I assume that it might be a little leak in the overall upgrade process. The solution however was quite simple:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo yum remove xorg-x11-drv-intel
sudo yum install xorg-x11-drv-intel
sudo shutdown -r now
</pre></div>


<p>After the reboot I got full hardware accelleration back and the UI responded quick and smooth again.</p>
<p>Despite this little glitch, I've had a very pleasant upgrade experience and almost everything was still where I expected it to be. In my opinion Fedora is a great distro with a very clean organization of the overall system. I'll upgrade my other systems soon as well and keep being a happy user of Fedora.</p>        </div>
