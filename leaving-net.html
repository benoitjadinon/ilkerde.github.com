        <p>Yesterday I blogged about my <a href="not-leaving-net.html">top 5 reasons why I like to stick with .NET technologies</a>. Today I'm going to look at the flipside. I already mentioned that I'm quite technology-agnostic when it comes to software development. However, after many years in the .NET ecosystem in different projects, I gained a lot of insights on how .NET projects are done. </p>
<p>Every working environment, literally every project has a different culture. Yet, there are similarities throughout projects. A few reasons for those similarities are similar technologies, similar tools and similar mindsets. That's true for the .NET-related projects as well.</p>
<p>I want you to notice once more that I'm neither <em>leaving nor staying</em> with the .NET technologies. I have perfectly valid reasons to use .NET, Mono, and FSharp, and <em>I surely will use these <strong>cool .NET technologies</strong></em>. However, I have good reasons to criticize some other aspects of the .NET ecosystems as well.</p>
<p>Although I mentioned it in yesterdays <a href="not-leaving-net.html">Top 5 reasons for using .NET</a> post, I want to emphasize once more, that the key to successful software engineering and successful software products is not the technology being used but the people being involved. Enough introduction.</p>
<h3 id="top-5-reasons-to-leave-net">Top 5 reasons to leave .NET</h3>
<p>Here's my top 5 reasons why I look forward to look for alternative technologies.</p>
<h4 id="nr-5-microsoft">Nr. 5: Microsoft</h4>
<p>Yes, you read correctly. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> has made it into my top five why I not like using .NET. The reason is dead simple. For many years, Microsoft left me as .NET developer think that .NET is the "new VB", the new shiny 4GL platform where everything works with click &amp; run. Moreover, instead of advocating serious engineering, Microsoft just wanted to sell .NET and the new VS versions as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">RAD</a> engineering tools. They actively made me as the seriously engaged .NET developer think that I'm at one level with VBA Macros and SQLWindows.</p>
<p>Second, the way Microsoft is supporting the .NET community is not focused on engineering, but focused on sales and marketing. That's the impression I got from many years of active .NET community participation. I'm still a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/germany/community/programme/clip.mspx">CLIP</a> Member, by the way. To me, Microsoft prefers shows their appreciation to people that <em>promote and sell their products</em> instead of showing appreciation people that <em>utilize and improve their products</em>. </p>
<p>This makes many .NET communities needlessly to be a sublte product and people marketing platform rather than a community of users and innovators. </p>
<p><em>I like to meet with developers, not with self-proclaimed heros or sales masters</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nr-4-homogenous-harmony">Nr. 4: Homogenous Harmony</h4>
<p>This topic is related to Micrsoft, but is not limited to Microsoft in .NET ecospace. It's about what I call the fallacy of "homogenous harmony". In professional .NET world, vendors try to lock you in with their products. You want a widget library? Take X. It plays very well with search library of vendor X, but not of vendor Y or vendor Z. This "Lock In, Feel Free"-Game is played over and over again, no matter what developer tool or library it is. Nearly all .NET vendors invest more in not supporting other vendor's tools than in investing to coexist with them.</p>
<p>This not only is depressing for the developer or a risk from strategic software product management point of view. No, the biggest negative impact is the active and effective lowering of innovation. This "unique partnership" strategy for developer tools leads to laziness and blindness for options. </p>
<p>Developers just stick with that lock-in because they know that they have no other option. That's the point where the developer as individual as well as the company is loosing innovation. </p>
<p><em>I prefer diversity over monotony</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nr-3-developer-productivity-tools">Nr. 3: Developer Productivity Tools</h4>
<p>Guess what, it goes on with the tool chain. I'll start with TFS. Just to get it out of my way. TFS is the perfect example for a contradicting product. While it claims to be a "Developer Productivity Tool", it's straight forward just the opposite of that. It merely embraces process guidances, guidelines and protectivism, that's it. Period.</p>
<p>The same is true for other products in .NET Devland. I'll pick the beloved Visual Studio as an example. The concept of all the fancy XML-, Resource-, Database-, Publish-, Webform-, HTML- and XYZ-Designers Visual Studio has is just to do one single thing: Hide complexity. Yes, you read correctly, complexity. You know what that means?</p>
<p>That means that you as Visual Studio "Developer" don't even get to know what you are doing. In the end, a developer doesn't need to be a developer anymore. It's just doing it because there's the menu option to do it. It's doing it because Intellisense says it's possible. It's doing it because there's a wizard guiding to "Finish Unit Tests".</p>
<p>This effectively means that your gained productivity is sold for being treated like a dumb user who is trying to get a paragraph formatting fixed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word">Word</a>, instead of being treated as an engineer who is responsible of actually knowing what the hell he is doing with all those bits and files he's juggling with. </p>
<p><em>I want to be taken for serious and not as dumb click-dummy</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nr-2-optimization-over-innovation">Nr. 2: Optimization Over Innovation</h4>
<p>First I thought this would be my number one, since the preceding arguments touch the fact (or lack, respectively) of innovation as well. In more than half of all my .NET projects, I perceived to live and deal with a culture where optimization is favored over innovation. </p>
<p>To me, this is one of the biggest Anti-Patterns of agile and modern software engineering. Hence, It's quite sad for me to realize that I happened to experience such a culture often. Interestingly, very often with .NET projects (of different sizes!).</p>
<p>I think that most .NET-related projects are profit-oriented with the notion that everything what is related to software engineering is valued as a cost rather than an investment. In consequence, budget plans are being made, resources are planned upon tasks and money is correlated with time instead of feature.</p>
<p>You might argue that this is just a characterization of enterprise projects and has very little to do with the technology being used. Very plausibe argument, indeed. Nonetheless it doesn't reflect my experiences. </p>
<p>For instance, I've had (very) large, enterprise-scale projects in PHP and C. For both of the projects, I've had plans and goals to achieve. However, in both projects I always had the chance to innovate prior to optimize. All my innovation efforts have been taken for serious, then evaluated and mostly adapted. </p>
<p>On quite a number of my .NET projects, the contrary was the case. People were awarded when they could reduce cost and they were punished when they could expand market and turnover. </p>
<p><em>I prefer innovation over optimization (while I do optimize as well)</em>.</p>
<h4 id="nr-1-no-invest-to-interest">Nr. 1: No Invest To Interest</h4>
<p>Yes, my number one reason for preferring other technologies over .NET is the lack of "invest to interest". As much as I am technology-agnostic, I haven't seen so many developers not being interested in their job as I did in a large number of .NET projects I made. What a sad sentence this is. Yet, it perfectly describes my experiences so far.</p>
<p>I've had one - <em>yes, one single</em> - .NET project so far where I had the genuine impression that every developer involved in that project was interested in what they actually are doing. <em>(Note: For the curious mind: parts of this project were codenamed after cuban cities.)</em></p>
<p>Even more, some of the uninspired developers were even advocated by project managers and Scrum Masters as "experienced, low-key and thoughtful" people. Just because they didn't do anything.</p>
<p>I'm well aware that this problem is not limited to .NET projects. There's tons of projects in other languages where the same is true. Yet, I happen to had the experience that especially within .NET projects the number of uninteresed, unwilling, unimpressed and unimproved "software developers" is exceptionally large compared to those few developers who actually take their job and assignment for serious. I'm quite glad to say that in my current projects the majority of developers actually do care.</p>
<p>The latter mentioned mostly are brave and very strong minded people. They mostly continue in a restless manner to improve whatever they can. It's a very sad fact that mostly those few are being looked at as "disruptive elements" and troublemakers. </p>
<p>This lack of "invest to interest", again, is one of the biggest Anti-Patterns of modern software engineering. It inherently leads to a protective, non-progressive and disrespective working environment in which it is very hard to achieve any valuable result. </p>
<p><em>I prefer to work the best I possibly can instead of working just as much as is necessary</em>.</p>
<h3 id="criticism-and-correlation">Criticism and Correlation</h3>
<p>As I already mentioned before, I'm well aware that most of the above arguments are not specific to .NET itself. It's a valid criticism of mine to argue that there's no concrete correlation between .NET as technology and the very "non-technology-related" statements I made. I do as well recognize .NET usage in indie game studios, movie and animation agencies and whatever 'cool' and 'hipster' startups and working environments there might be.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this list reflects my experiences I had so far on the majority of my .NET projects. I mostly gained the impression that the delusive culture of "professional engineering" in .NET ecospace is being aided and supported by the technology and the companies around that technology. This especially was the case where .NET and other .NET related products like TFS, various OR/M or Win/Webform-Libraries are being used to follow the "spirit of RAD".</p>
<p>On the other side, I had the chance to work on PHP, C, Java and JavaScript projects as well. For the vast majority of those non-.NET projects, I had a very different experience regarding the abovementioned perspectives. Especially my Nr. 1, 2 and 3 arguments were not as apparent and present as on almost all .NET projects I had so far.</p>
<p>That all being said, I still have great respect for all .NET enthusiasts and community members. In fact, I even do admire a few of them for their professionalism, for their passion and for their brave and powerful way of promoting the positive things of .NET as a technology as well as of the .NET community itself.</p>
<p>Moreover, I not only had a "perfect" .NET Project but also had a few .NET Projects where I met <em>very smart people</em>, learned <em>a lot of things</em> and had <em>a great time</em> building cool products with cool .NET technologies. I enjoyed .NET development very much and keep enjoying it.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives-and-advantages">Alternatives and Advantages</h3>
<p>I'm not sure whether any other comparably large and affecting technology would have significant advantages over .NET in the abovementioned points. Lately, I've been around the Java and Ruby communities and both are very different from eachother as well as different to the .NET community. </p>
<p>Last year I learned Ruby. Not inside out, but fairly well. It was a great experience. Both from technical as well as from personal perspective. This year, I'll most likely dig into Python, their related technologies and their communities. I'll learn FSharp, a .NET-related language, as well. </p>
<p>The message I want give to you, my dear reader, can be summarized quite easily: Take the chance and look beyond your known area. It surely will be of advantage for you. If you are a rubyist, look how the .NET way of events and UI binding works. If you are a .NET guy, look what advantages you can take away by experiencing how Rubyists deal with database migrations and testing. Either way, you can turn alternatives to advantages. And that's what I'll look after as well.</p>
<p><strong>Turn alternatives to advantages.</strong></p>      </div>
