          <p>For many years now I'm a happy Linux user. Admittedly, I haven't been much into Linux in my first years as professional software developer. I always needed something which was more or less better or faster achievable with Linux than with Windows, which for many years was my primary OS both for development and personal usage. At that time, I used Linux mainly as a server OS, mostly as a VCS-, File- or Webserver.</p>
<p class="articleimage"></p>
<p>Seven years ago I decided to bring Linux back to my desktop. I decided to give the compelling <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> distribution a chance. At that times <a href="http://www.ilker.de/ubuntu-upgrade-von-704-auf-710-feisty-auf-gutsy-funktioniert-nicht.html">I started with Ubuntu Feisty</a> in a dual-boot with Windows XP.</p>
<p>I was very satisfied with the "easy" experience of installation and configuration. I wasn't used to expect from a Linux OS to immediately have appropiate VGA drivers and display resolution. Prior to Ubuntu, I was mainly dealing with <a href="https://www.suse.com/">SuSE</a> the years before (starting with the very first version 4.2). With SuSE, it was almost impossible for me to use it efficiently as a desktop OS. I was lucky to manage network connections, firewall, samba and ssh on SuSE - no more, no less.</p>
<p>Back to Ubuntu. With Feisty and Gutsy, I got Linux to experience as a valid desktop OS. Although I wasn't using it as my main OS, I kept my curiousity on a constant scale to trigger me frequently back to use Ubuntu.</p>
<p>After two years of infrequent sessions with Ubuntu on my desktop I decided to hop around a little and give <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> a spin. By that time I already was fairly familiar with the distribution layout and toolset within Ubuntu. Since I knew Ubuntu being a derivate of Debian, I found Debian to be a valid next step in improving my understanding of Linux.</p>
<p>My Debian experience was fairly good. For most things, I knew how to deal with them. I even was surprised to have a better support for my hardware than I had with Ubuntu. However, it turned out to be a rather uninspiring desktop experience, since I was missing new shiny software which happen to be standard on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Granted, my time with Debian was more or less an "experimantal" phase. I tried <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> after being a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> user for many years. I experimented with IceWM, <a href="http://www.xfce.org">XFCE</a> and even got myself to fully configure a <a href="http://www.fvwm.org/">FVWM</a> environment. That was both fun and a great way to relearn things I forgot over the past years of the Windows regimen on my desktops.</p>
<p>Finally, three years ago I decided to <a href="/ubuntu-10-10-on-vaio-vpc-s12-v9e.html">completely switch to Linux</a>. My decision was mainly reasoned by the fact that I was working on both a Python and ASP.NET project which no longer forced me need to frequently get back to Windows. Since I already was using Windows on a VM for a couple of months (within Debian on a dual-boot installation), I got used to have Linux as my main OS.</p>
<p>So, my first full-fledged Linux desktop experience was again with Ubuntu (Maverick aka. "Perfect 10"). I had a great start since this was to me the first real experience to effectively and efficiently work on Linux as a desktop OS. I managed to develop the ASP.NET project with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> and <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">Monodevelop</a>, I got my first contact with the lovely <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language, I got rid of all the MS Office ratpack software by using <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> and GMail, I started to relearn <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>.</p>
<p>However, as time flew by, I happen to realize that Ubuntu was overloaded and freakingly packed full with plenty of useless and unfinished stuff. With the arrival of PPA's and the incredibly fast growth of packages, my system got regressed more often than I wanted it to be. Even me as non-expert, novice-level Linux user could recognize the lousy filesystem management, the inconsistent configuration strategies and the lack of solid tested core packages.</p>
<p>Despite the inner life of Ubuntu being degenrated to a big mess, the main reason for quitting with Ubuntu is the sick politics and strategy of Canonical. It started off with the debut of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)">Unity</a> in Maverick, continued with the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5953180/how-to-remove-amazon-ads-from-ubuntu-1210">dumbest idea ever made in Linux distribution history</a> in Quantal, and doesn't get any better with the drop of Wayland in favor of their own half-baked <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/">Mir</a>.</p>
<p>My conclusion: <strong>Ubuntu is out!</strong> Ubuntu is nothing more than a freaking wrong capitalizing of free software, surrounded with bloaty adware features and an overall attitude of this <em>"we wanna be cool and hipster like Apple but can't because we're too dumb"</em> company called <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>. Sorry to say it, but Ubuntu sucks!</p>
<p>Lucky me that I found a nice exit with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>'s Lovelock. Just a few days after its release, I installed <a href="/fedora-15-lovelock-on-sony-vaio-s-series.html">Lovelock on my laptop</a>. Admittedly, I didn't got everything running at first sight and with the new Gnome Shell, systemd and SELinux I certainly needed a coumple of months to get comfy with it.</p>
<p>After this slight ramp-up, Fedora was a very pleasant and stable distribution. Packages have good quality and are being updated frequently, the overall system is <em>clean</em> and <em>consistent</em> - both at the surface as well as behind the doors. I even installed Fedora on my tablet and had a great pleasure using it at meetings and for my day to day tasks.</p>
<p>Fedora gave me the possibility to (re)discover things. My tablet installation certainly was a motivation as well, since I had to deal with limited resources, although I was running the full-blown Shell with it. I tried <a href="http://www.xfce.org">XFCE</a> (again), <a href="http://openbox.org/">Openbox</a>, <a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a>, <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a>, <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> and many other niceties. I continued to happily use <a href="/gnome-shell-slow-after-fedora-17-upgrade.html">Fedora on my tablet</a> up to Beefy Miracle.</p>
<p>At that time, while I was constantly exploring the Linux ecosystem, I dived into the myriad of available Linux distros as well. I installed quite a fair amount of distros (on VMs), ranging from the obvious <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint</a> and <a href="http://www.mageia.org/en/">Mageia</a> up to the lesser known <a href="http://crunchbang.org/">CrunchBang</a>, <a href="http://www.sabayon.org/">Sabayon</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>. My primary motivation was to extend my knowledge of Linux as OS and ecosystem.</p>
<p>After a period of evaluation, I decided to move away from Fedora a few months ago. I could write a large blog only about this fairly complex and lengthy process of evalution and decision. To keep a long story short: I was quite satisfied with Fedora, yet I was missing simplicity and flexibility to a certain extent. I found myself compiling my own stuff to get things going as I wanted to. Hence, I concluded to move on and opt for Arch.</p>
<p class="articleimage2"></p>
<p>Today, I happily run Arch on two laptops for a couple of months. So far it's been a great experience. I wouldn't recommend Arch to people being new to Linux or people not willing to dive into details. </p>
<p>For me, Arch is a incredibly good match. Everything in Arch is <em>clear, transparent, consistent</em>. The community and the user repositories are great and not only put attention on detail, but on quality as well. Thanks to Arch, I'm learning more about Linux, from Kernel to X and back.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Arch requires attention and detail. If you're not willing to invest time, precision and accuracy in your system, Arch is not your proper companion. That being said, I'm very happy with Arch and find myself to be more efficient on my desktop than I ever was.</p>        </div>
