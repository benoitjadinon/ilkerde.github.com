### colors.less

Definition of colors used throughout the entire website.

The color system divides into two sections. The first section
defines the colors itself (similar to a palette definition).

The second section actually semantically defines which color
is used for whatever component on the website. By convention,
three color types exist:

- Foreground color, suffixed "_fg"
  This is the (primary) stroke color, used for text

- Background color, suffixed "_bg"
  This is the fill color, i.e. used for filled boxes

- Line color, suffixed "_line"
  The (secondary) hairline stroke color, used for borders

Apart from the color type, colors can be defined
for several object states as well. The default state
is the "idle" (or passive) state. It's the only state
which is not explicitly weaved into the color name.
In addition to the default state there's:

- over: user focuses object with mouse (mouseover/hover)
- active: highlighted, active object, important in context
- inactive: dimmed, inactive object, commonly unusable
- error: strong highlight, object is errornous

The main color set only contains greys, light whites
and the theme blue color called "ease".
