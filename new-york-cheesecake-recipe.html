I got inspired to write this post from yesterday's late eve <a href="http://twittonary.com/word.php?word=Twonversation">twonversation</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/agross/status/710189053382656">@agross</a> and the ever more undogmatic <a href="http://twitter.com/BjoernRochel/status/720272864845824">@BjoernRochel</a>. We talked about a nice <a href="http://blog.aheil.de/2010/11/05/test-driven-development-cheatsheet/">cheat sheet from Andreas Heil</a> while I was enjoying my honeyed citrus tea. While reading &amp; drinking, the desire of having a nice cheesecake came into my mind. </p>
<p>This is why I want to share this great cheesecake recipe with you.</p>
<p>Baking a cake is more or less easy. Baking a good cake however isn't easy at all. The below mentioned recipe is by no means "fool-proof". However, it's a good starting point for beginners. Whenever you feel suspicious about the "when's" &amp; "how's" of stirring flour and salt together, a glimpse to this recipe is a handy helper.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<p><em>for 12 servings</em></p>
<ul>
<li>160 g semisweet chocolate</li>
<li>75 g unsalted butter</li>
<li>180 ml buttermilk</li>
<li>100 g white sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>8 ml vanilla extract</li>
<li>210 g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>5 g baking soda</li>
<li>3 g salt</li>
<li>160 g semisweet (white) chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to ~200 degrees C. Line all muffin cups with papers.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the semisweet chocolate together with the butter. Let stand until cooled, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Lightly beat the egg. In a small bowl, stir together the chocolate-butter mixture with the buttermilk, sugar, egg, and vanilla, until blended well.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, soda, and salt. Make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients, pour in the chocolate mixture, and stir until just combined. Stir in the mini chocolate chips. Spoon the batter into the lined muffin cups.</li>
<li>Bake at ~200 degrees C for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove muffin tin from oven and let stand at least 5 minutes, before removing the muffins and letting them cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or cooled; can be frozen as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bon App!</strong> ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This blog is especially directed to Alexander &amp; Björn. I got the impression that both don’t see a big issue mixing up the terms “TDD” and “Unit Testing”. The attentive reader already might have recognized this parody on the post of Andreas.</p>
<p>Let me be very clear and precise about one thing: With this post I don’t want to lower the value and efforts of Andreas in any way. The contrary is the case. I do believe that the <a href="http://blog.aheil.de/2010/11/05/test-driven-development-cheatsheet/">Unit Testing Cheat Sheet</a> is very beneficiary in everyday work. As a fact, I downloaded it as well and most probably will use it from time to time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my point here is a different one. I somehow don’t want to mix up the terms “TDD” and “Unit Testing”. From my perspective, both TDD and UT share similarities (i.e. in mechanics), but serve different purposes anyway.</p>
<p>I know that there people outside being quite relaxed (or undogmatic ? :-) ) about this. This is ok. I also know people who don’t care about the bits aside of their coffee, as long as it is something tasteful and sweet. This is ok.</p>
<p>But for me, this makes a difference. A big difference, to be precise. Similar to people outside being quite picky about their ingredients when cooking nice dinners, I’m a little petty-minded when it comes to agile &amp; xp coding methods. I very much apologize for this, but for my belief, this is an important thing worth to be noted.</p>
<p>I want to thank Andreas for his great work of compiling the cheat sheet, since I will surely use it from time to time for verification and hardening.</p>
