        <p>It’s been quite a few years with me in the agile software engineering area. More precisely, my journey with agile methods started over with XP around 2003. That’s a decade of agile engineering practice and experience.</p>
<p>The good thing about this fact is: It does not tell you anything about the “completeness” of my experience. This is good for me as well, since it does mean that I’m not a “complete” agile practitioner. Nobody is. And that’s why I like to be an agile practitioner. Learning and improving for the better. Day by day.</p>
<p>And this actually is exactly the reason why I was so excited lately to be able to learn things about XP being new to me. Although I consider my knowledge and experience pretty well within this agile methodology, I’m still learning very useful new things.</p>
<p>One of those very useful things I learned a few months ago is the <em>Pair Stairs</em> chart. This chart typically is placed somewhere on the team or sprint board. It’s purpose and effectiveness is very simple: help the team do pair programming.</p>
<p>The chart itself is no more than a simple matrix of all team members (including testers, business analysts, sysops). Whenever two team members pair up, they mark their “pairing” with a dot, check or simple line. The team always strives to get the complete chart filled, which effectively means that the team has undergone all pairing combinations.</p>
<p><img alt="Pair Stairs" src="/media/images/pair_stairs.jpg" /></p>
<p>This chart often is called “pair stairs” because it looks like a “stairway” to knowledge sharing and team performance. If all stairs have been advanced at the end of the sprint, the team (and completely filled out chart as well) is called “pairmuted” (I think the reference to the mathematical concept of permutation is obvious here). Hence, a “pairmutating team” is a team where all team members paired with each other at least once within a sprint.</p>
<p>A very smart and useful extension to the “pair stairs” chart are task markers. Instead of marking the pair with a single checkbox on the stair, the topic or task is being placed on the stair using a post-it. It turns out that this variation is very powerful, since it enables everyone on the team to see how the topics are being tackled by the team.</p>
<p>Although I learned about this chart just a few months ago, the chart itself is quite known and <a href="http://itnaut.com/pairing_staircase">established as an XP practice</a>. It’s been in use for over a decade now in XP community and has proven to be <a href="http://alaverdyan.com/readme/2010/12/pair-programming-matrix-board/">very effective</a>. </p>
<p>I personally remember that a few participants at <a href="qcon-london-2009-a-brief-summary.html">QCON 2009</a> mentioned to work with “pair stairs” in their teams. I honestly have to admit that by that time I didn’t knew what they were takling about and that I haven’t felt any urge to ask them what these “stairs” are all about. </p>
<p>Now, four years later, I know better.</p>      </div>
