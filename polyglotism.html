          <p>There's a lot of discussion going on around me these days about programming languages. Especially when it comes to learning new languages, I sense a sort of divide between two camps of thought. I'll just name those groups "progressive" and "excessive" language thinkers. <em>Progressive</em> is for the polyglot guys who are almost steadily learning new languages. <em>Excessive</em> is the contrary thought of learning one language to its ultimate extent up to a "zen" level, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="multimate-maniac">Multimate Maniac</h3>
<p>You surely already have realized that there's no mutual exclusiveness for <em>progressive</em> and <em>excessive</em> schools. However, in practice I often find myself in a debate between both. That's primary reasoned in the fact that practitioners of both strategies tend to go overboard with it.</p>
<p>The progressive language learners mostly pick a language or two and learn them for a given timebox, most often a year or so. They try to dive into the language concepts very fasts and practice their newly gained knowledge with pet projects, such as writing blog applications or other relatively small scaled software.</p>
<p>The excessive language learners usually do some up-front evaluation of languages and paradigms for a certain time, ranging from a couple of weeks up to years. After having made up their mind, they explicitly choose one language and stick with that language for years. Their goal clearly is to fully utilize the language as well as the ecosystem surrounding it.</p>
<h3 id="being-progcessive">Being Progcessive</h3>
<p>I'm personally able to relate to both approaches. Nonetheless, I feel myself more comfortable with the progressive approach. I'm a firm believer of diversity and short feedback cycles. Hence, I like to pick a language and dive into it for a while (usually a couple of months). If I'm interested and find myself learning new perspectives - or if the language enables me to raise my productivity in some cases - I usually opt to stick with that language for a year or more.</p>
<p>The great benefit I was experiencing in learning new languages certainly was to find new perspectives. Like different approaches to common solutions because the language supports different features. Like different program design because different idioms of modularity, objects and data structure design exist. </p>
<p>In past years, I delved into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actionscript">ActionScript</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLSQL">PL/SQL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">C#</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_%28programming_language%29">Processing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29">Ruby</a>. This year I'll dig into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">Python</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">F#</a>. However, there's only a few where I safely would categorize my knowledge as <em>profound</em>, namely JavaScript and C#. That's mainly because I was very excited about both languages in the beginning and the middle of the last decade (C# ~2003, Javascript ~2006). This mixed approach might well be entitled <em>progcessive</em>. </p>
<p><em>(BTW: I know, I'm not good at creating new words, but I wanted to give myself a try. That's why I'm rather a computing linguist than a natural linguist ;-)).</em></p>
<h3 id="one-language-rules-all">One Language Rules All</h3>
<p>Apart from all those programming languages in the field and the rise of language-orientation, I finally want to make a (personal) point on being a "polyglot programmer". I believe that it's a good thing for both your "resident" language skills and the languages you might explore and visit to be curious. Being a polyglot programmer not only broadens your "programming speech", but enables you to reason better about your engineering tasks. </p>
<p>Even for non-developers like testers, business analysts, scrum masters, product owners and managers, I <em>strongly</em> recommend them to learn a new programming language from time to time. Not necessarily the language they might be in contact with through development colleagues. Just the language they happen to find interesting or useful for their particular needs.</p>
<p>However, from the past years of professional experience I had as developer, team lead, architect, scrum master and manager, I came to the conclusion a few years ago that there's <em>one single language</em> (plus dialects) every professional in modern software engineering must learn.</p>
<p>Yes, right. <em>Every Pro</em> in Software Development has to learn this essential language, which effectively is the language to rule them all: the <strong>customer language</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="wysiwyt-what-you-say-is-what-you-think">WYSIWYT: What You Say Is What You Think</h3>
<p>If you want to succeed in creating software, the customer language is indispensible. This perspective has been in software development since the very first beginning. It started out with <em>requirements</em> encompassed with a <em>glossary</em>, it continued on with <em>use cases</em> and <em>scenarios</em>, up to <em>user stories</em> and <em>feature fares</em>.</p>
<p>Even in a very technical sense, the customer language was always in focus. It started with <em>business routines</em> and <em>business modules</em>, was superceded then with the object-oriented <em>domain model</em> and there even has been improved with various principles such as the <em>ubiquituous language</em> from DDD.</p>
<p>The goal of all those principles and methods is simple: <strong>understand your customer</strong>. or user. or both. <em>(Yes, there's a difference between customer and user, but I won't dig into that now).</em> The thing is: if you want to <em>understand</em> your customer, you need to <em>listen</em> to your customer. But listening ist not all. You need to <em>comprehend</em> what you're <em>listening to</em>, you need to <em>ask questions</em> to what you're listening to, you even need to <em>refine and improve</em> to what you're listening to.</p>
<h3 id="language-and-translation">Language and Translation</h3>
<p>Admittedly, it's not easy, often impossible, to learn the complete customer language and the underlying concepts and semantics of the domain in question. However, you don't need to be a domain expert or customer whisperer to understand your customer. The key thing here is to <em>constantly care about the communication between you and your customer.</em></p>
<p>That being said, the're so many techniques and methods who can help you to understand your customer and let him understand you. As a longterm XP practitioner, the customer test specifications always were in customer language stripped down to keywords and actions. This has evolved to a number of key practices to learn the language of your customer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">Behavior-Driven-Development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven-Development</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example">Specification By Example</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, learn at least one of the practices mentioned above and I guarantee you: you will understand your customer better than before. Even better, learn all of them and you will understand your customer as never ever before. Now, if there's really only one single thing you absolutely need to know in the field, then you'd better choose learn and practice the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin</a> language.</p>
<p>Be a polyglot. Learn new languages, new perspectives and new paradigms. Yet, first and foremost, learn the language of your customer and be sure to regularly practice it.</p>        </div>
