          <h2>The Cosmopolitan Chalta Hai</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="content" class="article">
        <p>Well, this is the kind of articles I find to be one of the most challenging. It's about culture. And, to even furthermore raise the bar, it's about a foreign culture. At least a culture foreign to most of us Europeans.</p>
<p>Today, I want to reflect my perception and opinion about an attitude from the indian culture called <em>Chalta Hai</em>. Before I get into what "Chalta Hai" is and how I see Chalta Hai to be, I want to tell you my story on how I came in contact with this attitude. Naturally, my first contact with Chalta Hai was in an international project with great collegues from India. By that time - around 2010 - I didn't knew anything about this attitude and naturally couldn't name it. However, I somehow "felt" that in certain situations my indian collegues were behaving different than what I was used to.</p>
<p>Three years later I had the chance to be part of an international project with a global, distributed team again. And again I got great teammates from India. And again I found myself wondering about the "coolness" of some of our indian collegues. Luckily, I got the chance to have a chat about this coolness with a nice and smart indian guy on my project.</p>
<p>While we were relaxing from the mental marathon of the meeting with a cup of tea, we came to discuss exactly this thing I was perceiving as "coolness" of my indian teammates. As I was asking how on earth they can stay calm and cool in critical situations where <em>pressure</em> and even <em>insults</em> are being throwed on their faces, my smart indian friend just smiled back to me and answered: "It's <em>chalta hai</em>, my friend".</p>
<h4 id="what-is-chalta-hai">What Is Chalta Hai?</h4>
<p>He continued to explain to me that <a href="http://samosapedia.com/entries/3862/Chalta%20Hai!">Chalta Hai</a> is an internal, deeply rooted attribute of the indian culture of living. It stems from Buddhism in a certain sense, as he started to detail it out. If one were to translate "chalta hai" from hindi language, it would more or less translate to <em>"it moves"</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chalta Hai</em> means <em>it moves</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It moves? Yes, it moves. In such a sense, that the world keeps moving around. That whatever happens, it will be over and let another thing happen. In a sense that the past is past and the present is the thing we refer to as the "flow of time". Well, you know, it moves.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, that Chalta Hai is being perceived and referred to as a <a href="http://agrawalsanjeev.blogspot.de/2011/07/intolerable-chalta-hai-attitude.html">negative</a>, more or less <a href="http://snehal-tripathi.blogspot.de/2012/11/chalta-hai-aur-chalta-rahega.html">counter-productive</a> attidute in contemporary indian living. As for the business perspective, Chalta Hai is being criticised as a "<a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/-chalta-hai--is-a-nono-in-business/951416">No-No</a>". </p>
<p>Most Indians claim that it substantially hinders the indian economy to deliver innovation and leading-edge performance. Just because of the fact, that Chalta Hai raises a sort of agnostic view to the outcome of any activity. Indians refer to this as a kind of "whatever comes, whatever goes" feeling. Something like we in Europe more or less get a notion of when we are listening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae">Reggae</a> music while looking to a colourful Bob Marley poster.</p>
<p>But as it turns out with so many things in life, it's not as simple as that. Chalta Hai seems not to be only this one-dimensional thinking of "whatever happens will happen". It seems not only to favor the inability to seriously commit to any goal or target. Chalta Hai seems to be different. At least as I have been told to from my indian collegues. </p>
<p>In its root, ancient sense, Chalta Hai takes care about the soul and inner balance. It does not foster agnostic behaviour, but sharpens the mental sensory for self-destructive thinking. This further explanation reveals an important aspect of Chalta Hai to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chalta Hai</em> does not want to limit the future, but wants to limit the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain words: Chalta Hai is a relaxing attitude towards what already has happened, not towards what happens or is about to happen. However, one might then think of this attitude to embrace irresponsibility. Interestingly, even most indians think that way. They argue that constantly referring to "Chalta Hai" results in irresponsibility. While this certainly is true to some extent, that again does not seem to be the whole story.</p>
<h4 id="dont-relax-do-refocus">Don't Relax, Do Refocus</h4>
<p>As I onderstood from my indian collegues, Chalta Hai - in the core buddhistic sense - is to protect you from psychological distress. It reminds you to take care of your emotional landscape and strive not to expand your emotions too far for all the things that already have happened. </p>
<p>As I listened to this detail of the explanation, I immediately thought of the "Don't take care about the past, take care about today" kind of feeling. I felt like Chalta Hai is like a personal mental note: The only thing connecting the past to the future is what we are doing, not what we did or what we plan to do.</p>
<p>"You're quite close to chalta hai" my teammate responded as I rephrased my thoughts and opinions about what I have been told so far about it. "It has certainly a negative impact as well", he continued, "in such a way, as it is a very easy hide-out to not reflect upon what has happened." That made sense to me.</p>
<p>"However, it merely wants to guide your attention to the future and the power you have. It wants to amplify your forward-thinking. It's more like <em>keep it moving</em> than <em>remain in feelings</em>".</p>
<p>"Ok", I thought to myself. While Chalta Hai wants to empower activity and a progessive way of life, it often causes the opposite. People more often seem to refer to Chalta Hai when they want to say "relax, no stress whatsoever" instead of using it for "let's refocus on what we can do".</p>
<h4 id="one-to-many-problem">One-To-Many Problem</h4>
<p>Nonetheless, this seems to be a critical problem in social life of India. I totally understand that indians want to ban "Chalta Hai" from society when it is used to "relax the past" only. Like if someone does harm to others or some other cruelty like natural hazards become true. This is serious and needs to be reflected upon seriously. It doesn't help anyone if happenings are "relaxed" without any other notion of consequence. However, as I have been told Chalta Hai to be, it's Chalta Hai that tells us not only to reflect upon what has happened, but take action as well.</p>
<p>To be frank, most of the time Chalta Hai is perceived to have a negative impact to the society. That's quite reasonable, since Chalta Hai only addresses the "mental well-being" of yourself, not the overall society you're living in. What that means is that while Chalta Hai might resolve your inner distress, it may not be able to resolve the distress of a group. Even if everyone in that group is responding to Chalta Hai for themselves, the overall distress may remain or even might be amplified.</p>
<p>This is a very common problem to what I personally like to refer to as "One-To-Many-Problem". It's not limited to Chalta Hai, but obviously is present in this type of thinking as well. Interestingly, this problematic effect is ready to be observed in a number of examples in indian social life. Your Chalta Hai is not mine, my Chalta Hai is not yours. This space of individuality is inherent to Chalta Hai, but limits its power as well.</p>
<h4 id="the-cosmopolitan-way">The Cosmopolitan Way</h4>
<p>Well, although I never lived in indian society nor have had the chance to have a stay in India for a substantially long period, I think I can have my own opinion about Chalta Hai. It's certainly very different from what it's supposed to be. Even more, it's surely very different to the Chalta Hai being lived in India right now. Hence, I want to differentiate my perspective by calling it "the cosmopolitan chalta hai".</p>
<p>My cosmopolitan Chalta Hai has an emphasis on the aspect of <em>movement</em>. I see Chalta Hai to be more a driver for activity, while it certainly keeps to send me a little message of <em>the discontinuation of the past</em> in the background. Even more, I don't want to be reminded too often to Chalta Hai. </p>
<p>My Chalta Hai wants to be in place in case of great or unexpected emotional distress. My Chalta Hai wants to be there whenever critical or shocking situations are going to be faced. Hence, my Chalta Hai is not an everyday attitude. No, it's something I don't want to be reminded to in my everyday life. However, I feel safe and sound to have <em>my personal attitude</em> of Chalta Hai in my back. It will remind me to <em>keep on moving</em>, no matter what happens.</p>
<p>Apart of that, I wish that this deeply rooted <em>Chalta Hai</em>-attitude in India will not be taken as an excuse for inactivity, imperfertedness, or inequality. I hope that the indian culture can take their own roots to reflect upon and act towards the positive and progressive kind of living.</p>      </div>
