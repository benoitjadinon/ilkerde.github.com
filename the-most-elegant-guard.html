      <div id="content" class="article">
        <p>Last year I blogged about <a href="the-elegant-guard.html">an elegant Guard</a>. This was a piece of code I saw in a codebase I was reviewing at that time. I saw how the guard was used:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ArgumentsNotNull</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">section</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">inception</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">expiry</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At that time, I found this solution to be quite elegant, while I wouldn't have used it myself at all. I'm using guards quite frequently in projects, but most of the time they look similar tthis:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NotNull</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;arg&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yes, the string literal with the name of the argument is not nice. Sometimes I make the second parameter optional, leaving me to a guard usage of</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Guard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">NotNull</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which works. I didn't think about the correctness of my approach up until recently. Yesterday, I was thinking about the guards being used in several projects I'm reviewing right now. They are all very different, although essentially tackling the same problem. I have to admit that the guard I was attributing as <a href="the-elegant-guard.html">an elegant Guard</a> last year now is not so elegant to me anymore. It's too much overhead for the purpose of the guard, me thinks.</p>
<p>Even more, I think guards should be avoided. Guards are no good. I strongly believe that they only can help if they are used in <em>unavoidable cases</em>, such as interfacing with other systems or dealing with interop or guarding against highly volatile, stateful components. In all other cases, which is a surprisingly large area, guards can be avoided. Just because <code>NULL</code>s can be avoided.</p>
<p>In order to have a coded manifest of what I mean by that, I reimplemented a guard again. This time, I <em>intentionally</em> left the guard being "feature-incomplete". For instance, it lacks detailed reporting of the argument name being null. Plus, it is only able to check one parameter at once. That's by purpose, because I wanted to implant the philosophy of avoiding <code>NULL</code> and avoiding guards within the guard itself. I call it <a href="https://github.com/ilkerde/guardian">Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/3komma14/Guard">There</a> <a href="https://github.com/sh4dov/Guard">are</a> <a href="https://github.com/oakio/ArgGuard">dozens</a> <a href="https://github.com/littlebits/guard_claws">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/Haacked/NullGuard">guard</a> <a href="https://github.com/dustindavis/FluentGuard">helpers</a> <a href="https://github.com/liteguard/liteguard">out</a> <a href="https://github.com/danielwertheim/Ensure.That">there</a>. A few of them even are trying to solve it through some sort of meta-programming. The truth is, that in the end, they all do the same thing: Throw an exception when the argument is null. With a little bit of invest in thinking, it soon becomes obvious that the <em>purpose</em> of a guard helper is aligned to following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <em>arguments</em> of a method against null.</li>
<li><em>Abort</em> execution of the program when an argument is null.</li>
<li>Provide information for <em>developers</em> on where the unexpected null appeared.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two conditions can be met very easily, while the last condition is sort of debatable - as a concept as well as a concrete implementation. <a href="https://github.com/ilkerde/guardian">Guardian</a> tackles the third condition from a conceptual perspective. In particular, the problem of reporting the location of the <code>NULL</code> reference is solved by not solving it.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>Guardian</em> exists to be not used at all (or at least as rare as possible). The most important thing here essentially is the insight to <strong>avoid <code>NULL</code></strong>.</p>      </div>
