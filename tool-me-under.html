        <p>Yes, it's time for another blog about some misfits I happen to recognize in our software development world. This time it's about tools and their glorification by those who actually should know better: the developers themselves.</p>
<h4 id="a-tool-is-just-a-tool">A tool is just a tool</h4>
<p>Everybody probably knows it already, but I wanted to re-iterate that: A Tool is just a tool. Tools are very important these days for software development. Literally every developer needs his own set of tools. Plus, in professional software development, tools are an indispensable means to get things done.</p>
<p>As for the developer perspective, it's the IDE, the editor, the shell, the issuetracker, the CI-engine, the VCS and many more software making up the "tool chain". However, even hardware can be counted a tool: It seems to be a big difference these days to use a MBP, a <em><insert brand name here></em> notebook, a desktop or even an IPad as primary development system.</p>
<h4 id="give-me-the-tool-you-fool">Give me the tool, you fool</h4>
<p>Lately, I got the impression that tools not only are important to us, but have become more important than they actually should be. Whenever a developer sets up a new box around me, he's asking questions like</p>
<ul>
<li>what editor are you using?</li>
<li>what shell is coolest?</li>
<li>what plugins are shiny?</li>
<li>what is hip, my hipster hippies?</li>
</ul>
<p>On one hand, I understand that it's important to look out for improvements and make some research on it. On the other hand, I don't get it why those questions are being asked.</p>
<p>Even more, I don't get that tool X and tool Y is being used "just because it gives you good geeky karma." What's that for an argument? Are you serious? Are you a developer cranking out some code or just a barbie doll looking out for fashion shoes? I don't get it.</p>
<h4 id="tools-to-the-rescue">Tools to the rescue</h4>
<p>I think it's a very good thing to look around what's happening and evaluate new methods and tools. Nonetheless, I personally prefer to actually <em>use a tool</em> only if I obviously <em>need a tool</em> and then <em>value that tool</em> and eventually <em>compare that tool</em> with others in the field. For a few developers around me, I have the impression that the tool chain is just being chosen because it's kind of hip and geeky.</p>
<p>Take  Resharper, VS Power Tools, Zsh, VIM, ST2, MBP, WebSharper, c9.io and whatever freaky tools might exist in this universe as an example. I personally use VIM for around 2 years now. I'm not even at 10% of what is possible with VIM. And this was and is a great lesson for me. Both positive and negative.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can't (and don't want) to miss Visual Studio and Resharper when it comes to serious .NET development. That's cool and fine for me. I love those tools (for specific tasks). However, I wouldn't ever touch a CSS or HTML file with VS. YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="tool-me-under">Tool me under!</h3>
<p>I'd like to encourage developers to <em>first use what they have</em> and <em>look around if existing tools can help</em> to improve, automate or simplify the task they're actually need to get done. Once you see that your tool-chain limits you or leads you to inefficiency, the motivation for new tool evaluation is very well satisfied, Imho.</p>
<p>Don't just follow the white rabbit and cry out to be equipped like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers">transformer</a> just to edit a simple README file.</p>      </div>
